# IoT Location Tracking Project

## Project Overview
The project involves developing a web-based application to track simulated device positions within a defined area. The main goal is to demonstrate location tracking capabilities using simulated IoT data without any physical hardware.

## Specific Problem Addressed

### Problem Statement
Organizations often face challenges in managing and monitoring asset locations within large campuses, warehouses, or industrial facilities. Traditional GPS tracking solutions require costly hardware, making initial deployments expensive and time-consuming.

### How the Project Solves the Problem
This project addresses these challenges by:
- Offering a cost-effective alternative to hardware-based location tracking.
- Allowing organizations to simulate and test location-tracking strategies virtually before actual deployment.
- Reducing deployment time by validating systems in a virtual environment first.
- Facilitating training for personnel in managing asset tracking systems without needing physical devices.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python (3.9.1)**: Main programming language.
- **Flask (2.1.2)**: Web framework for RESTful API creation.
- **CounterFit**: Virtual IoT device simulator generating GPS-like data.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing location data.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: User interface development.
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive map visualization for location data.
- **Axios**: API communication between frontend and backend.

### Hosting & Deployment
- **Netlify**: Hosting for frontend.
- **Heroku or similar service**: Hosting backend Flask application.

## System Architecture

### 1. Simulation Layer
- **CounterFit** generates virtual GPS data.
- Simulated data represents device movements within a specified area.

### 2. Backend Layer (Flask API)
- Receives simulated data from CounterFit.
- Manages data storage, retrieval, and processing.
- Exposes API endpoints to deliver data to frontend.

### 3. Database Layer
- SQLite used to store simulated positional data.
- Tracks historical location data for each simulated device.

### 4. Frontend Layer
- React.js app fetches data from Flask API via Axios.
- Interactive maps provided by Leaflet.js for real-time visualization.
- Allows tracking and visualization of simulated devices' movements.

### 5. Hosting & Deployment
- Frontend application deployed via Netlify.
- Flask API deployed on cloud-based hosting such as Heroku.
